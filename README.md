# Global-Earthquake-Tsunami-Data-Analysis
## 🌍 Earthquake–Tsunami Data Analysis (2001–2022) 

This project presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global earthquake events with a focus on identifying the seismic patterns that contribute to tsunami generation. By examining more than two decades of earthquake data, the analysis highlights geographical trends, magnitude–depth relationships, statistical indicators, and visual patterns that distinguish tsunami-triggering earthquakes from non-tsunami events. The goal is to provide meaningful insights that support improved seismic risk awareness and tsunami forecasting.

## 📌 Project Overview

The analysis is based on the Global Earthquake–Tsunami Risk Assessment Dataset, covering the years 2001 to 2022.
Through detailed exploration, the project investigates:
How earthquake events vary across time and regions
Differences in physical characteristics (magnitude, depth) between tsunami and non-tsunami earthquakes
Geographic clustering of tsunami-prone seismic activity
Statistical relationships between major seismic variables
Visual representations that make complex patterns easier to interpret
Two comprehensive reports accompany the notebook, offering explanations, findings, and visual summaries.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
1. Time-Based Seismic Trends
Observe yearly variations in the number of earthquakes and tsunami events
Identify whether high-magnitude earthquakes are increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable
Examine how seismic behavior evolves over a 22-year span

2. Magnitude and Depth Studies
Analyze magnitude distributions to understand how energy release correlates with tsunami occurrence
Examine depth patterns to determine how shallow vs. deep earthquakes influence tsunami generation
Highlight extreme seismic events (≥ 8.0), including their depth and energy signatures

3. Geographic Earthquake Patterns
Visualize global earthquake locations using 2D scatter plots
Use color-coded markers to differentiate tsunami-related events
Identify clusters near subduction zones, coastlines, and tectonic boundaries
Highlight regions with recurring tsunami-generating seismic activity

4. Statistical and Comparative Insights
Use histograms, boxplots, and bar charts to compare tsunami vs. non-tsunami events
Use correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between magnitude, depth, and tsunami flag
Explore how statistical variability differs between event categories
Summarize differences in seismic behavior based on visual evidence

5. Interpretation and Risk Indicators
Identify magnitude thresholds (often ≥ 7.5–8.0) linked to higher tsunami potential
Understand why certain geographic areas experience repeated tsunami-triggering quakes
Examine how depth variability influences the energy transfer required to generate tsunamis
Highlight how quantified patterns can support future tsunami early-warning efforts

## 📊 Visualizations Included
The analysis includes a wide range of visualizations that make complex seismic data easy to interpret:
Global Earthquake Distribution Plot: Shows worldwide seismic locations across two decades
Tsunami vs. Non-Tsunami Scatter Plot: Highlights event type differences using color-coded markers
Hexbin Density Map: Reveals high-density clusters of tsunami-generating earthquakes
Magnitude & Depth Boxplots: Compare statistical properties of both event categories
Magnitude Histogram: Shows the frequency distribution of seismic magnitudes
Occurrence Bar Chart: Compares annual counts of tsunami and non-tsunami events
Correlation Heatmap: Displays the strength of relationships among key seismic variables
Multi-Plot Summary: Combines several visual insights into a unified overview
Each visualization contributes to understanding the seismic characteristics that matter most for tsunami prediction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
This project is implemented entirely in Python and makes use of several essential scientific libraries:
Python 3.x – primary language for analysis
Pandas – data cleaning, structuring, and manipulation
NumPy – numerical computing support
Matplotlib – creation of detailed static plots
Seaborn – enhanced statistical visualization tools
These libraries enable efficient computation and the creation of visually clear, information-rich plots.

## 📈 Key Insights
The analysis reveals several important findings:
Magnitude plays a critical role in tsunami generation, with most tsunami-triggering quakes occurring above 7.5 on the magnitude scale.
Shallow earthquakes have significantly higher tsunami potential due to the rapid displacement of ocean water.
Tsunami events cluster along coastal subduction zones, particularly where oceanic plates dive beneath continental plates.
Depth variability is higher in tsunami-linked earthquakes, showing a wider distribution compared to non-tsunami events.
Correlation studies show strong positive relationships between magnitude and tsunami occurrence, whereas depth behaves more variably.
Geographic plots indicate that the Pacific Ring of Fire remains the most active and tsunami-prone region globally.
These insights, taken together, strengthen the understanding of seismic conditions that elevate tsunami risk.

## 📄 Reports Included
Two PDF documents summarize the findings, visualizations, and interpretations:
Earthquake_Tsunami_Analysis_Report.pdf – A concise overview of the analysis, visual interpretation, and key insights
Exploratory Analysis of Global Earthquake.pdf – A detailed breakdown of methodology, observations, and seismic behavior patterns
Both documents complement the notebook and provide accessible explanations suitable for academic or research use.
